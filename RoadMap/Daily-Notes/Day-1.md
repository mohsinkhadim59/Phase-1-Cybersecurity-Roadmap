## Reflections
- What I learned today:

  ```bash
	ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
	cat readme
	cat ./-
	```
- What needs review:
		All the files are stored inside the `Bandit` directory in which i have saved in the text files using the `cat > <content>` and then we can save the line/content and then you can save the name of the file while exiting in the current working directory.
